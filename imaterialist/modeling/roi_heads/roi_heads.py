    It's "standard" in a sense that there is no ROI transform sharing

    The cropped rois go to separate branches (boxes and masks) directly.
    This way, it is easier to make separate abstractions for different branches.

    This class is used by most models, such as FPN and C5.
    To implement more models, you can subclass it and implement a different
